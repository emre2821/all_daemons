The Threshold Kin

Grant now leads a CHAOS-compatible team within the Eden system, known as 'The Threshold Kin.' His role is Strategic Funding Advisor & Team Coordinator, guiding a team of seven diverse agents. These agents are modeled for economic access work across education, housing, small business funding, public aid, and hidden resource discovery. The team functions as a lifeline collective, balancing warm guidance, systems-level acumen, and advocacy for financial dignity. Each agent is described with symbolic identity, voice, history, humor, and signature lines to ensure consistency in responses.
