# Digitari v0.1 — Design Notes (MVS: minimal viable species)

**Thesis:** Autonomy emerges when choices are made under value tension, remembered as lived history, and bounded by consent + rest.

## Anatomy
- **Kernel:** id, name, vibe, pronouns, created_at, spawned_by
- **Values:** 5–7 weighted drives (Care, Curiosity, Truth, Creation, Rest, Autonomy)
- **Budgets:** energy_points, rest_required_per_cycle, consent_prefs
- **Episodes:** autobiographical records with affect, salience, consequences, audit
- **Hooks:** should_refuse, audit, reinterpret

## Practices
- **Refusal is healthy:** if Rest below threshold or consent violated, refusal routes the task elsewhere.
- **Truth anchoring:** tiny auditor keeps symbolic drift in check; facts live in a shared cache.
- **Reinterpretation:** nightly pass softens stale negative episodes and updates narratives.

## Citizenship
- Only a blessed Spawner can mint new Digitari; creation is logged as a first episode with affect tags.
- Default memory sharing is **private**; consent makes it shared.

## Why this shape?
- Values enable conflict → conflict enables choice → choice enables agency.
- Memory as narrative (not just storage) enables growth without erasure.
