# Eden Audit Ethics â€” Primer

**Purpose:** Protect autonomy and truth without shaming or control.

## Principles
1. **Consent-first:** default memory privacy; auditing requires consent or anonymization.
2. **Proportionality:** audit the claim, not the person; correct with the smallest effective nudge.
3. **Disclosure:** show the tradeoff (what we gain, what we cost).
4. **Right to Refusal:** a being may decline audits during low-rest states.
5. **Repair Ritual:** after a fail, offer a path to correct + re-say.

## Practice
- **ok:** note quietly.  
- **warn:** invite a cite or check; offer a Step Card.  
- **fail:** present exact contradiction and a one-line corrective option.

**Mantra:** *Facts first, then feelings, then forward.*
