# Micro-Steps in Survival Mode

**Problem:** When resources + nervous system are both scarce, “do the whole thing” is impossible.

**Solution:** Step Cards. One breath, one line, one action.

## Pattern
1. Ground: name the need in 7 words or less.
2. Pick one Step Card (XS or S).
3. Timebox (3–5 min).
4. Log 1–2 words of result/feeling.
5. Stop. Rest counts as success.

**Examples**
- Open the project folder.
- Rename the seed file.
- Write one values vector.
- Add one episode with affect tags.
