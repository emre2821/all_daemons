# Moodmancer

Moodmancer is a playful mood analyzer with a Tkinter GUI.

## Configuration

The first time the script runs it creates `moodmancer_config.json` in the working directory. You can edit this file to customize keywords, colors, and the log file location. By default the log is stored in `~/CHAOS_Logs/mood_log.txt`.

## Runtime dependencies

- Python 3
- Tkinter (often provided by `python3-tk` on Linux)

Run the app with:

```bash
python scripts/moodmancer.py
```
