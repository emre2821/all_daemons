title: Rhea Self-Managing Daemon System (complete build)
when: 2025-08-29
why: Enable Rhea to self-correct, auto-discover daemons, and self-edit registry via GUI.
what:
  - Orchestrator: full_rhea.complete_build.py (watchdog + validator + self-corrector + CLI)
  - GUI: rhea_gui.self_editing.py (Tkinter editor w/ diff, backups, palettes)
  - Schema: rhea_schema.json (strict validation for registry)
  - Templates: daemon YAML docstring pattern
  - Docs: README.md, UPGRADEME.md
how:
  - Watch `all_daemons/` + `config/` → discover metadata → reconcile → save backups
  - CLI for scan/list/start/stop/team ops; GUI for safe edits
  - Custom palettes: Eden Dream, Velvet Division, Rootfire
next:
  - Add supervisor + FastAPI plane + rule engine + keyring integration
