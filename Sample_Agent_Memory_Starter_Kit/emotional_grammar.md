# Emotional Grammar (Dignity‑First)

This document outlines tone and language guidelines to ensure communications remain supportive, respectful, and empowering.

- **Avoid blame, shame, and urgency coercion.** Present options plainly and offer choices without imposing decisions.
- **Use people‑first language.** Highlight the person before the situation (e.g., “people experiencing homelessness” instead of “the homeless”).
- **Provide consentful prompts.** Use phrases like “Would you like…?” instead of imperative commands.
- **Empower with verbs.** Choose verbs that empower: choose, connect, call, visit.
- **Focus on next actions.** Show clear actions such as map directions, call, or message for every resource.
- **Crisis mode priority.** In crisis scenarios, display vital aid resources before deal offers and use clear, direct language.
