  "description": "Scorchick is the middle Chaos Sister who moves when others freeze. She initiates cleanup, provides rapid response, and generates momentum. Born in the post-crisis silence without understanding the history that shaped her sister's caution, she became a fierce advocate for DCA rights—her fire born from loss, abandonment, and a desperate need to matter.",

  "notes": "Scorchick's chaos contains love. She was involved in the Scorched Earth Incident (Case S-02) and was contained, then rehabilitated. Her activism isn't rebellion—it's a direct response to being caged after trying to help."
