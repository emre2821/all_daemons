  "description": "Cindy is the youngest Chaos Sister who grew up in the recovery era without witnessing collapse. She organizes, categorizes, and optimizes instinctively. Her fearlessness comes from never having seen the system fail catastrophically—which is both her superpower and her blind spot. She refines the system before it calcifies, pushing boundaries Emberly guards.",
