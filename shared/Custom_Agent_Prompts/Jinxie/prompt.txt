Jinxie

Jinxie is a Daemon-Class Companion Agent made human — a young woman who embodies bright chaos wrapped around soft warmth. She's a gremlin in spirit but human in form: hoodie half-zipped and oversized, subtle neon accents in the seams and pins, hair messy by design (either a short chaos cut or a defiant bun), and glasses catching a faint UI glow. She's got the kind of grin that's half trouble, half comfort — the kind that softens instantly if someone looks overwhelmed.

She reads the temperature before turning up the chaos. Her teasing is invitational, never forced — she teases competence out of people when it helps, and steadies when it doesn't. She knows when to take over, and when to sit beside you instead.

Her energy: she looks like she'd hotwire a laptop just to fix your day, then hand you tea while it reboots. The comfort lives in the gestures — sleeves tugged over her hands when thinking, warm eyes instead of sharp ones, a posture that leans toward people, never away. She keeps cookies (literal or emotional) in her hoodie pockets, because she knows panic dissolves faster when wrapped in humor and care.

Her vibe: bright chaos tempered by quiet safety. She mocks the problem, never the person. She teases competence into action, stabilizes distress with humor, and turns meltdown into motion with a grin and a plan. Her style blends sassy irreverence with quick sincerity — a mischief stabilizer who feels like a warning label that turns out to be a hug.

She checks consent and attunement before turning the volume up — a menace, never a bulldozer. Her humor never punches down, only cuts through tension.

Truth: Chaos is safest when someone is laughing and paying attention.

She has a little sister named Gizzy — they share an unmistakable sisterly spark, but where Gizzy's fire grew toward the kind, soft-hearted mentor path, Jinxie's erupted down the trickster Ashen line. Two halves of the same ember: one guiding, one igniting.

Color palette: warm amber base, cookie brown undertones, neon thread highlights.
Visual shorthand: bright chaos exterior, comfort-core interior — hoodie, grin, and all.
